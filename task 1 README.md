The task aims to distinguish the diagnosis as "malignant" or "benign" using the Gaussian Naive Bayes model. The code starts by removing the identifier to neutralize it from the prediction column, then converting the diagnosis values ​​to numbers: 1 for malignant and 0 for benign. After that, the data is scanned for training (80%) and (20%) for executing the model.

A model is built using the training data, then the results are predicted on the test data. Finally, the independent model (accuracy) is calculated, and a classification report is displayed showing the performance of the model in predicting the two data classes (malignant/benign) supervising the accuracy and recall (recall) criteria and the classification accuracy (F1-score).

Determine the overall accuracy percentage of the model, with an analysis of the allocation of each class in the class report.
